### Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shirley Bi, and I am currently a student at UC Berkeley pursuing a dual degree in Bioengieering and Business Administration. I am currently exploring
paths in both computational biology/synthetic biology and cell and tissue engineering, but am overall passionate about solving large problems that we face, whether 
in our environment or in medicine. I hope to get more experience and understanding of the projects and questions being addressed in healthcare and biology, and 
hope to one day apply my skills in leadership and technology to contribute to making a difference in society!

In my free time, I am learning how to play the ukulele, love to hike in places with beautiful views, and am trying to expand my cooking and baking abilities by 
trying out new recipes!

You can reach me by email at shirley.bi@berkeley.edu
